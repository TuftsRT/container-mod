Description: Braker3 is BRAKER3 enables the usage of RNA-seq and protein data in a fully automated pipeline to train and predict highly reliable genes with GeneMark-ETP and AUGUSTUS. The result of the pipeline is the combined gene set of both gene prediction tools, which only contains genes with very high support from extrinsic evidence.
