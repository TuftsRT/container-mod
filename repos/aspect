Description: ASPECT is a code to simulate convection and tectonic processes in Earth and other planetary bodies. It has grown from a pure mantle-convection code into a tool for many geodynamic applications including applications for inner core convection, lithospheric scale deformation, two-phase flow, and numerical methods development.
