Description: TargetP-2.0 tool predicts the presence of N-terminal presequences: signal peptide (SP), mitochondrial transit peptide (mTP), chloroplast transit peptide (cTP) or thylakoid luminal transit peptide (luTP). For the sequences predicted to contain an N-terminal presequence a potential cleavage site is also predicted.
