Description: chewBBACA is a comprehensive pipeline including a set of functions for the creation and validation of whole genome and core genome MultiLocus Sequence Typing (wg/cgMLST) schemas, providing an allele calling algorithm based on Blast Score Ratio that can be run in multiprocessor settings and a set of functions to visualize and validate allele variation in the loci. chewBBACA performs the schema creation and allele calls on complete or draft genomes resulting from de novo assemblers.
